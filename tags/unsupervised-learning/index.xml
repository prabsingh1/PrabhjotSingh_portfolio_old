      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my data mining class, we were required to create an R based tutorial for any data science concept that we wanted to learn more about. My project group and I decided that a comprehensive overview on unsupervised learning would be an intersting concept to dive into. Therefore we created a step by step guide on when and how to use unsupervised learning techniques, including pricipal component analysis and different clustering algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
